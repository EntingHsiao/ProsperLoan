# ProsperLoan

In the project, I conducted the exploratory data analysis and created an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of Prosper's loan data.

Prosper Marketplace,Inc., which was founded in 2005, is America’s first peer-to-peer lending marketplace, Borrowers request personal loans on Prosper and investors (individual or institutional) can fund anywhere from $2,000 to $35,000 per loan request.

This report explores the Prosper’s loan data, which contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, and it was Last updated on 03/11/2014. The dataset will be used for exploring two main ideas 1) Investors’ preferences 2)The relationship between borrowers’characteristics and the risks.

The tasks in this project are as follows:

* Introduction
* Univariate Plots Section
* Univariate Analysis
